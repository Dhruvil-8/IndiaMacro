# IndiaMacro: Analyst Guide & Walkthrough

This document serves as the **User Manual** for the India Macro Research System. It details the financial logic, operational workflow, and how to interpret the signals generated by the framework.

## 1. System Philosophy
Markets are driven by three forces:
1.  **Liquidity ("The Tide")**: Capital flows (FII/DII) determine the medium-term trend.
2.  **Fundamentals ("The Engine")**: Earnings and Credit Cycles determine the long-term trend.
3.  **Sentiment ("The Waves")**: Fear and Greed (Vol, Rates) drive short-term price action.

This system is designed to quantify all three using a rigorous, event-driven architecture.

## 2. Notebook Walkthrough (The Pipeline)

The system consists of numbered notebooks that **must** be run in sequence.

### Phase 1: Data Digestion (Layer 0)
*   **`00D_flow_data_loader.ipynb` (The Tide)**
    *   *What it does*: Extracts Balance of Payments (BoP) data from RBI.
    *   *logic*: Calculates a **Rolling 3-Year Z-Score** of Net Portfolio Investment.
    *   *Insight*: High Z-Scores (>1.5) indicate structural inflows (Bull Market). Low Z-Scores (<-1.5) indicate capital flight (Crisis).
*   **`00E_nowcast_fci.ipynb` (The Waves)**
    *   *What it does*: Aggregates daily/weekly market metrics into a **Financial Conditions Index (FCI)**.
    *   *Components*: 10Y Yields (Cost), Call Rate (Liquidity), FX Vol (Fear).
    *   *Insight*: Rising FCI = Tightening Conditions (Risk Off). Falling FCI = Easing (Risk On).
*   **`00F_monetary_banking.ipynb` (The Engine)**
    *   *What it does*: Calculates "Central Banker" metrics.
    *   *metric*: **Credit Impulse** (Change in new lending). This is the single best leading indicator for GDP (leads by 9 months).

### Phase 2: Alignment (Layer 1)
*   **`01A_frequency_decision_matrix.ipynb`**
    *   *What it does*: The "Brain" of the system. It maps disparate data frequencies (Daily Market, Monthly Flows, Quarterly GDP) to a unified trading timeline.
    *   *Critical*: It handles **Publication Lags** (e.g., Inflation data comes with a 1-month delay; the system accounts for this to prevent look-ahead bias).

### Phase 3: Signal Generation (Layers 2-4)
*   **`02A_structural_correlation.ipynb`**: Checks if correlations are breaking (e.g., Stock vs Bond correlation flip).
*   **`03A_regime_classification.ipynb`**: Classifies the economy into 4 Regimes:
    *   **Goldilocks**: High Growth, Low Inflation (Buy Equities).
    *   **Reflation**: High Growth, High Inflation (Buy Commodities).
    *   **Stagflation**: Low Growth, High Inflation (Cash is King).
    *   **Deflation**: Low Growth, Low Inflation (Buy Bonds).

## 3. How to Use the Dashboard

Launch the dashboard with:
```bash
streamlit run notebooks/dashboard.py
```

### The "Master Control Room" Views:

#### A. Top Deck: Real-Time Stress
Look at the **FCI Gauge**.
*   **Green**: Financial conditions are loose. Supportive for equities.
*   **Red**: Conditions are tight. Stress in the system. Reduce leverage.

#### B. Middle Deck: The Tide
Look at the **Liquidity Z-Score**.
*   **Above 0**: Structural Inflows. Buy-the-dip works.
*   **Below 0**: Liquidity withdrawal. Rallies are likely selling opportunities.

#### C. Lower Deck: The Engine
Look at the **Credit Impulse**.
*   **Rising**: The economy is accelerating. Banks are lending. Bullish for Cyclicals/Banks.
*   **Falling**: The economy is slowing. Banks are tightening. Defensive rotation needed.

## 4. Maintenance
*   **Monthly**: Download the latest RBI DBIE data and run `00D` and `00F`.
*   **Weekly**: Run `00E` to update the FCI with latest Yields and FX data.
*   **Daily**: The dashboard will auto-update if you have a live feed for the `data_raw` files (e.g., automated scraper).

## 5. Educational Note
This framework replicates the **workflow** of a macro hedge fund, but it is a research tool. Real trading requires risk management, execution algorithms, and proprietary data that are outside the scope of this open-source project.
